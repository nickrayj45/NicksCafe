          The word "coffee" entered the English language in 1582 via the Dutch
          koffie, borrowed from the Ottoman Turkish kahve, borrowed in turn from
          the Arabic قهوة qahwah. The Arabic word qahwah was traditionally
          held to refer to a type of wine whose etymology is given by Arab
          lexicographers as deriving from the verb قَهِيَ qahiya, "to lack
          hunger", in reference to the drink's reputation as an appetite
          suppressant.
